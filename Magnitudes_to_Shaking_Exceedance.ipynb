    "Deriving Probability of Shaking Exceedance from Source Earthquakes\n",

    "\n",
    "The goal here is to take an array of shaking source magnitudes and convert them to an array of rates of exceeding some shaking threshold $Y_t$.  Combined with a model of underlying processes (eg. Poissonian) we can turn an average rate into a probability of exceedance over some time period.  The main steps are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Using a set of ground motion prediction equations (We are using Cua \\& Heaton), take magnitudes and distances to predict the average shaking contribution from each source to each spatial bin\n",
    "* Of course, due to uncertainties, this is merely the *average* shaking associated with these distance/magnitude inputs.  The uncertainty in these shaking equations is typically log-normal. To find the probability that this source magnitude, at this distance, will cause shaking exceeding our threshold $Y_t$, we integrate the uncertainty distribution from $Y_t \\rightarrow \\infty$ for each spatial bin\n",
    "* We can now multiply this array of probabilities by the rate that such a source earthquake occurs.  This yields the rate of exceedance for this one source magnitude.Repeat the process for each source magnitude, summing together the exceedance rate contributions from each source\n",
    "* If desired, convert each bins total rate of exceedance to a probability using an assumed probability distribution for the events, e.g. Poissonian"
